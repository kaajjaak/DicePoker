# Dice Poker
A simple dice poker game in C#. Mostly a showcase of a project I had fun working on during my free time in highschool.


## Backstory

I made this project after another student made the exact same project but in ~10k lines of code checking each individual case using if statements.

I told the teacher his program was incredibly inefficent but the teacher told me she looked at this code herself and it was the best way to do it. 

I knew this was wrong so in order to prove this, I ended up making this project in an hour or two.
